   Hi! Im a Cerberus! Although I may look scary, Im just like any other normal       puppy... just, with 3 heads! Not too long ago we were recognized! Turns out you fools thought we were dead! Come on if I were to die, YOU WOULD HAVE TO COME WITH US. But now that you know I'm not dead, let me tell you about me. Im cary the Cerberus! i was roaming the earth in 2,000B. we are still on earth, in the wizarding world, my friend, Fluffy, is in Hogwarts.
